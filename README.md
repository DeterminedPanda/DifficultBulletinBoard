## Usage

### Accessing the Bulletin Board

You can open the bulletin board interface by left-clicking on the DifficultBulletinBoard Minimap icon or by typing ```/dbb``` into your chat window.
The interface will show an ordered list of messages from the world chat.

### Editing and Managing Entries

To manage topics, left-click on the config button to open the options window and select which topics to follow by selecting or unselecting the corresponding checkbox.

## Troubleshooting

### No Messages Show Up?
If no messages appear on your bulletin board and no errors are displayed, make sure you are in the **world chat** by typing `/join world` in-game.

### Tags List Issues?
If your tags list seems incorrect or disorganized, try pressing the **Reset Defaults** button in the options window.  
It’s also a good idea to reset the tags after updating the addon, as I may improve or adjust the tags list in future updates.
